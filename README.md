# TopWords
This program takes input from txt documents. Then as it processes the txt documents it will enter the  phrases in a hashtable. Everytime the phrase matches a value in the hash it will increase the integer. When the integer is increased it will check the last place in the vector to check if it enters the list. If it enters the list it checks if it can go up the list. If it is already in the list it just checks if it can go up. With this the program will output in the example.txt the time it took to process the txt document, the top phrases and the times the phrases were seen.
